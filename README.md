# discordbitcoinbot
To make the Discord bot code work, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Set up a Discord bot:
   - Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
   - Under the "Bot" tab, click on "Add Bot" to create a new bot user.
   - Copy the bot token, which will be used to authenticate your bot.

2. Install required libraries:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and install the required libraries by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install discord.py requests
     ```

3. Modify the code:
   - Open the code in a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code.
   - Replace `'your_bot_token'` with the bot token you obtained from the Discord Developer Portal. The line should look like this:
     ```python
     bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
     ```

4. Run the bot:
   - Save the modified code.
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the Python script.
   - Run the script by typing the following command:
     ```
     python your_script_name.py
     ```
     Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

5. Invite the bot to your server:
   - Go back to the Discord Developer Portal and select your application.
   - Under the "OAuth2" tab, in the "OAuth2 URL Generator" section, select the "bot" scope.
   - Scroll down and select the necessary bot permissions based on what your bot needs to do (e.g., read messages, send messages).
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your web browser.
   - Choose a server where you want to add the bot and follow the authorization process.

6. Test the bot:
   - Once the bot is added to your server, you can use the `$bitcoin_wallet_info` command followed by a Bitcoin wallet address to fetch information about that wallet.

Remember that you should keep your bot token and sensitive information secure. Do not share your bot token or any private keys in public places like GitHub repositories or public forums. 
Also, ensure that your bot has the necessary permissions to read and send messages in the channels where you want it to function.
